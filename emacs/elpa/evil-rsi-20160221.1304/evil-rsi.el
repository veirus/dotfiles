;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This program emulates `vim-rsi` initially developed by Tim Pope
;; (tpope). It brings some essential `emacs` motion bindings back.
;;
;; `<C-n>` and `<C-p>` are important keys, and will be enabled only
;; when `auto-complete` is enabled.


;;; Example:
;;
;; `<C-e>` to move to end of line in all states
;; `<C-d>` to delete to delete character to the right in `insert` state
;; `<C-k>` to delete current line in `insert` state


;;; Code:

(require 'evil)

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode evil-rsi-mode
  "Rsi mode."
  :lighter " rsi"
  :global t
  :keymap (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
            (evil-define-key 'insert map "\C-o" #'evil-execute-in-normal-state)
            (evil-define-key 'insert map "\C-r" #'evil-paste-from-register)
            (evil-define-key 'insert map "\C-v" #'quoted-insert)
            (evil-define-key 'insert map (kbd "C-S-k") #'evil-insert-digraph)
            (evil-define-key 'motion map "\C-e" #'end-of-line)
            (when evil-want-C-w-delete
              (evil-define-key 'insert map "\C-w" #'evil-delete-backward-word))
            map)
  (if evil-rsi-mode
      (progn
        (evil-update-insert-state-bindings nil t)
        (when evil-want-C-w-delete
          (define-key minibuffer-local-map [remap kill-region] #'evil-delete-backward-word))
        (define-key evil-ex-completion-map [remap evil-insert-digraph] #'kill-line)
